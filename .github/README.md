Terracord
=========
Terracord is a [Discord](http://discord.com/) <-> [Terraria](http://terraria.org/) bridge plugin for
[TShock](http://tshock.co/). The plugin enables the bi-directional flow of messages between a Discord text
channel and a TShock server. This project is inspired by [DiscordSRV](https://github.com/DiscordSRV/DiscordSRV)
which is a Discord <-> [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/) chat relay plugin for [PaperMC](http://papermc.io/)
and [Spigot](http://www.spigotmc.org/).

Terracord is written in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and is licensed under the terms of
the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). This project makes use of
[Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) and the [Terraria API](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TerrariaAPI-Server).

### Installation
1. Simply copy `Terracord.dll` and its dependencies into your TShock `ServerPlugins` directory. The dependencies should
be contained in any release zip archive and includes the following files: `Discord.Net.Core.dll`, `Discord.Net.Rest.dll`,
`Discord.Net.WebSocket.dll`, `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`, `System.Collections.Immutable.dll`, and `System.Interactive.Async.dll`.

   Ensure that the version of `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` copied to the `ServerPlugins` directory is >=11.0.2. This is a required 
   dependency of Discord.Net. The instance of this DLL included with TShock 4.4.0 is older (10.0.3) and using it results in
   not being able to establish a connection to a Discord server.

   For localization support, copy any or all language directories (`de`, `en`, `ru`, etc.), each containing
   `Terracord.resources.dll`, to the top-level directory where `TerrariaServer.exe` resides. You may then set the preferred
   locale in `terracord.xml` to make any supported language active.

2. Edit `terracord.xml` to set your bot token and Discord channel ID. This file should be saved to the `tshock > Terracord`
directory. Other settings in this configuration file may also be changed to your liking. The channel ID can be obtained by
enabling developer mode in your Discord application and then copying the ID of the relevant text channel you want to relay
Terraria messages to. A channel ID appears as a long string of numbers. The process is described
[here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-). In order
to obtain a bot token, you will need to create a Discord bot application. The process is described
[here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).

3. If desired, give the Discord bot **Manage Channel** permission on the text channel it is configured to use. This is required
to dynamically update the channel topic with information about the Terraria server.

4. Restart your TShock server to load the plugin. For review or troubleshooting purposes, `terracord.log` can be found in
the `tshock > Terracord` directory.

:warning: Unfortunately, Terracord may not work with [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/). This is due to Discord.Net
not supporting Mono.

### Building
#### Visual Studio
1. Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) if you do not have the software. The community
edition is free and contains the essentials to build Terracord. In particular, you want the ".NET desktop development" workload.
The "NuGet package manager" is also required to pull in the Discord.Net dependencies. Other individual components such as
debuggers, profilers, "Git for Windows", and the "GitHub extension for Visual Studio" may be useful.

2. Obtain a copy of the Terracord source code if you have not already. This can be performed with
`git clone https://github.com/FragLand/terracord.git`. You may alternatively
[download a zip archive of the source](https://github.com/FragLand/terracord/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents
to an arbitrary location.

3. Download the latest [TShock release](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/releases).

4. Create a directory named `lib` at the same path where `Terracord.sln` resides.

5. Extract `OTAPI.dll`, `TerrariaServer.exe`, and `TShockAPI.dll` from the TShock zip archive and then place these 3 files
under the `lib` directory you recently created during step 4.

6. Open `Terracord.sln` using Visual Studio.

7. NuGet should automatically download Discord.Net and its dependencies based on `Terracord.csproj`. If not, you can manually
install `Discord.Net.Core` and `Discord.Net.WebSocket` via NuGet. You may also attempt to right-click the solution in the
"Solution Explorer" of Visual Studio and then left-click "Restore NuGet Packages".

8. Use `Build->Build Solution` or `ctrl+shift+b` to build Terracord.

9. If all goes well, you should have a shiny new `Terracord.dll` at the path referenced in the build output. Enjoy!

#### .NET Core
1. Install [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1). .NET Core SDK 3.1.100 is known to
successfully build Terracord. You can also [configure various Linux package managers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-package-manager-debian10)
to install .NET core. This has the added benefit of being able to easily update the software.

2. Obtain a copy of the Terracord source code:

   `git clone https://github.com/FragLand/terracord.git`

   Or:

   `wget https://github.com/FragLand/terracord/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip`

3. Download and extract the latest [TShock release](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/releases):

   `wget https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/releases/download/vx.x.x/tshock_x.x.x.zip && unzip tshock_x.x.x.zip`

4. Create a directory named `lib` at the same path where `Terracord.sln` resides:

   `mkdir terracord/lib`

5. Copy `OTAPI.dll`, `TerrariaServer.exe`, and `TShockAPI.dll` to `lib`:

   `cp OTAPI.dll TerrariaServer.exe ServerPlugins/TShockAPI.dll terracord/lib`

6. Install dependencies:

   `cd terracord`

   `dotnet restore`

7. Begin build:

   `dotnet build -c <Debug|Release>`

8. You should now have a `Terracord.dll`.

#### Mono
:warning: As mentioned previously, loading `Terracord.dll` with Mono may not work considering Discord.Net does not
support this. Therefore, the following steps should be considered experimental.

1. Install Mono and NuGet. Under [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), this can be achieved via:

   `apt-get install mono-complete nuget`

2. Obtain a copy of the Terracord source code:

   `git clone https://github.com/FragLand/terracord.git`

   Or:

   `wget https://github.com/FragLand/terracord/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip`

3. Download and extract the latest [TShock release](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/releases):

   `wget https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/releases/download/vx.x.x/tshock_x.x.x.zip && unzip tshock_x.x.x.zip`

4. Create a directory named `lib` at the same path where `Terracord.sln` resides:

   `mkdir terracord/lib`

5. Copy `OTAPI.dll`, `TerrariaServer.exe`, and `TShockAPI.dll` to `lib`:

   `cp OTAPI.dll TerrariaServer.exe ServerPlugins/TShockAPI.dll terracord/lib`

6. Install dependencies:

   `cd terracord`

   `nuget restore Terracord.sln`

7. Begin build:

   `xbuild /p:Configuration=<Debug|Release> Terracord.sln`
   
   Or:
   
   `msbuild /p:Configuration=<Debug|Release> Terracord.sln`

8. With luck, a wild `Terracord.dll` will appear.
